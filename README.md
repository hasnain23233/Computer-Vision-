<H1>Computer Vision - Facial Expression Detection</H1>
This project demonstrates how to detect facial expressions using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python. The model is trained on labeled facial images to classify seven different emotions, achieving accurate results using TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV..

# Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies facial expressions into categories like happiness, sadness, anger, and more. The model uses a CNN architecture and is trained on a dataset of facial images from various sources.

# Key Features
Facial Expression Classification: Detects emotions from facial images.
Deep Learning Model: Implements a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras for expression detection.
Image Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model performance.
Model Accuracy: Achieves 65% accuracy.
