<H1>Facial Expression Detection using CNN</H1>
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect facial expressions from images, achieving 65% accuracy. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the model is built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras.

# Overview
The goal is to classify seven facial expressions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) using a CNN. The dataset is preprocessed to enhance model performance, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

# Key Features
Facial Expression Classification: Detects emotions from facial images.
Model Accuracy: Achieves 65% accuracy.
Built with: TensorFlow/Keras, Python, OpenCV.
